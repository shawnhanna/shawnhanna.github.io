    I worked for TORC Robotics from June 2014 through December 2016 as a Software Engineer. While working here, I had the pleasure of working on new and exciting projects in the Perception field of robotics. These projects included applications of statistical modeling, computer vision, machine learning, sensor fusion, and sensor requirements design. In addition to the Perception work at TORC, I was a member of the <a href="/projects/Team_ViGIR">Team ViGIR DARPA DRC team</a> that participated in the DRC Finals in California in 2015.
