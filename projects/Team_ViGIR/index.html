<p>
  I was a member of Team ViGIR for the DARPA Robotics Challenge from January through June of 2015. While on the team, I developed software to ensure robust communication in a simulated disaster scenario, with a low-bandwidth/intermittent network connection from the operator to the robot.

<p><i>
Team ViGIR (Virginia-Germany Interdisciplinary Robotics), comprising researchers from TORC Robotics, Technische Universit√§t (TU) Darmstadt, Virginia Tech, Oregon State University, Cornell University, and the Leibniz University Hanover was a collaborative research and development effort aimed at advancing the state-of-the-art in humanoid robot control in order to allow for effective human-robot teams. Our goal was to enable robots to more effectively respond to humanitarian disasters, thereby reducing the risk to humans.</i>
