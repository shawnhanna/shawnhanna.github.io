<p>
  I was a member of the Astrobotic Google XPRIZE team as head of Software Development for the rover
</p>

<p>
  The software team's integration of all hardware systems used on the rover was key to the rover's overall success.  The 90 day schedule, along with constantly changing hardware, required an agile development cycle and a robust, flexible architecture.  There are many problems faced when developing complex, fault-tolerant software for space, and developing a robust system that can handle the hostile environment in space was a challenge.

  This class project spanned 90 days, consisted of a team of 22 multi-disciplinary students from CMU with a goal of creating a lunar rover that could satisfy all of the major GLXP milestone requirements.
