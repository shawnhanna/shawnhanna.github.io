  <p>
    I began working in CMU's HCII department as a Senior Software/Systems Engineer for the CHIMPS lab under Professor Jason Hong. The CHIMPS lab focuses on research involving ubiquitous computing and usable privacy and security solutions for users. I am working on several projects for the lab, using several different technologies. My main conerns here are ClearTerms, a crowd-sourced, machine learning algorithm for detecting the most important statement in terms and conditions, and another project (retricted per US DOD) dealing with controlling app's ability to access user's private data.
